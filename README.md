### Projects

I currently have seven projects in my repository, including both public and private ones. While some of the public projects may still be a work in progress, I'm a perfectionist when it comes to code and strive for optimal results. I aim to spend more time optimizing them in the near future.

One of the projects I am currently working on is a starter framework based on Spring Boot. It provides essential functionalities and allows us to quickly set up a backend for other projects without starting from scratch. Here's a workflow diagram of this project:
